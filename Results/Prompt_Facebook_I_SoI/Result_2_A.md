- Category snapshot (implications → acquisition)
  - Competitors convert via “friendly kitchen,” “technical maker,” or “course/credential” funnels:

    - Alchemy of Herbs — kitchen-first + video bonuses [LearningHerbs]
    - The Modern Herbal Dispensatory — technical “how to make 250 remedies” [Mountain Rose Herbs]
