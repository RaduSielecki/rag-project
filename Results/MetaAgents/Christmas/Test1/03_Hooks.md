- 0.0–0.7s: motion or hard cut; hook in VO within 1.5s.

## 4. Originality Filter (Per Hook)

**Hook 1 – “When Christmas flu hits at midnight, this is my first grab.”**  
- Originality Note: Unique via specific time + “Christmas flu” + nightstand visual; avoids vague “sick season” trope.

**Hook 2 – “The holiday Home ER kit I wrapped for myself.”**  
- Originality Note: Self‑gift + “Home ER kit” language + brown‑paper package makes it brand‑specific vs generic “self‑care gift.”

**Hook 3 – “Hosting Christmas? Here’s my no‑panic plan for sick guests.”**  
- Originality Note: Targets host anxiety and “plan” anchored to this specific book’s cold/flu pages.

**Hook 4 – “If a Christmas blizzard killed the power, what’s in your medicine bin?”**  
- Originality Note: Combines weather scenario + “medicine bin” + physical book; most competitors don’t stress bin/go‑bag.

**Hook 5 – “The only Christmas gift in our house that doesn’t need Wi‑Fi.”**  
- Originality Note: Analog vs tech contrast tied to herbal reference; not easily reusable by digital‑only herbal brands.

**Hook 6 – “Our ‘inflation shield’ Christmas gift: one book, 250 remedies.”**  
- Originality Note: Explicit number (250) + “inflation shield” + focus on remedies makes it clearly this product.

**Hook 7 – “Instead of a bath set, I wrapped her a whole apothecary.”**  
- Originality Note: “Whole apothecary” wording + specific shot of this book and known remedies.

**Hook 8 – “The low‑tox Christmas bundle: Bible, recipes, and this herbal book.”**  
- Originality Note: Triad of Bible/recipes/herbal book is highly specific to this brand’s Christian/homestead subsegment.

**Hook 9 – “Holiday party glow, without mystery chemicals, from one book.”**  
- Originality Note: Low‑tox beauty combined with “one book” that has named remedies—not generic skincare plug.

**Hook 10 – “Christmas Eve tradition: one story, one scripture, one remedy.”**  
- Originality Note: Ritual of scripture + remedy is unusual; clearly tied to a remedy volume, not generic.

No hooks failed the originality checklist; none required full rewrite.
