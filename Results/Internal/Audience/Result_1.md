1. **Women in perimenopause/menopause seeking non-hormonal relief for symptoms**  
   - **Reason why:** They’re dealing with hot flashes, sleep issues, anxiety, weight changes, and joint pain but often want to avoid or minimize HRT and prescription meds.

3. **Parents of anxious or highly sensitive teens who want gentle, non-pharma support !!**  
   - **Reason why:** These parents see anxiety, stress, and sleep issues in their kids but are hesitant to jump straight to prescription medications. They’ll value step-by-step calming teas, sleep aids, and nervous-system–supporting remedies with clear dosage and safety guidance.

4. **Adults recovering from long-term antibiotic use who want to rebuild gut and immune health !!**

5. **People with recurrent herpes (cold sores or genital) seeking better outbreak management**

7. **People with mild hypertension who are trying to avoid going on blood pressure medication**  
   - **Reason why:** With “borderline” or stage 1 hypertension, they feel the pressure (from doctors and family) to act but fear side effects of meds.

The book’s liver-supporting herbs, bitters, and daily tonic recipes let them support detox pathways realistically and long term.

9. **People frequently traveling (or working public-facing jobs) who constantly catch colds and flus**  
   - **Reason why:** Flight attendants, sales reps, teachers, front-desk workers and rideshare drivers are exposed to every bug. They want preventative immune tonics, on-the-go cold/flu remedies, and natural “first line defense” so they can cut illness short and avoid repeated pharmacy runs.
